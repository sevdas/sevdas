### Hello, it is [Sevda 🔊](https://namedrop.io/sevdashukrieva) is here! 

I am an ex-fashion designer | physical product developer, passionate about building thoughtful things, branding, visual arts, and cognitive science.

After several years (actually 7) of fashion journey, I started learning to code so I can develop my logical reasoning, and 
problem-solving skills, plus I could still build stuff yet in a more sustainable way! Following a few UX/UI principles, 
I build my own website from scratch so I can be a part of the community-made out of great values named [Founders and Coders](https://www.foundersandcoders.com/) 
and become a full-stack JavaScript developer.

- 💁 When not coding, I enjoy coocking with friends and family, doodling, streaming arthouse cinema, being in the nature, reading non-fiction mostly memoirs, playing mucis: [🎵🎵🎵](https://open.spotify.com/user/ss_official)
- Fun fact: I belive in singularity and do my daily choices based on sustainable facts.
