## Hello, it is [Sevda üîä](https://namedrop.io/sevdashukrieva) here! 

I am an ex-fashion designer / physical product developer, passionate about building thoughtful things, branding, visual arts, and cognitive science.

After several years (actually 7) of fashion journey, I started learning to code so I can develop my logical reasoning, and 
problem-solving skills, plus I could still build stuff yet in a more sustainable way! Following a few UX/UI principles, 
I build my own website from scratch so I can be a part of the community-made out of great values named [Founders and Coders](https://www.foundersandcoders.com/) 
and become a full-stack JavaScript developer.
