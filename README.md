## Hello, it is [Sevda üîä](https://namedrop.io/sevdashukrieva) here! 

I‚Äôm a former multidisciplinary fashion designer turned Product Engineer, with a passion for building thoughtful products. My work lives at the intersection of design, culture, and technology - shaped by my background in branding and visual arts, and my curiosity about how people experience and interact with products.

After seven years in the fashion industry, I pivoted to code - driven by a desire to expand my problem-solving skills and explore more innovative, future-minded ways of creating. Following UX/UI principles (and a bit of stubborn curiosity), I built my portfolio site from scratch using vanilla JS. That journey led me to [Founders and Coders](https://www.foundersandcoders.com/), a community rooted in strong values and ‚Äútech for good‚Äù, where I grew into a full-stack JavaScript developer.
